Fergus' Sound Change Applier

FSCA is a [conlanging](https://conlang.org) tool designed to aid in the development of naturalistic constructed languages. As the name suggests, FSCA is primarily a sound change applier; it takes sound change rules and applies them to words of a proto- or pre-lang, but it has a bunch of other handy features, too, like automated word derivation and chronology. I began development on this project to help me with my Germanic daughter-lang, Thjudesk (AKA Scaudsesk).
